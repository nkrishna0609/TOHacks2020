## Inspiration
As we are currently in the midst of a pandemic, we have all noticed that there are extremely lengthy line-ups in front of grocery stores, often taking 20-30 minutes to traverse, due to social distancing principles. We decided to create a product which would assist in eliminating these lines; by allowing people to book time slots beforehand to go and buy their necessities. We believe that the more attention Bookorona receives from people who stand in these line-ups, the greater of a chance they themselves will try out our faster and more efficient alternative.

## What it does
Bookorona allows users to view and select available time slots, ranging from from 10 to 60 minutes of qualitative shopping. Once they select their desired slot, they can simply arrive at the store at that time, scan the store's respective QR code pictured in our dashboard. Once the system validates the user's booking, the user will be able to enjoy their shopping trip.

## How I built it
We used a myriad of technologies to build our app, such as React Native, React, GCP, MongoDB, and Python. React Native was used for the mobile app, React was utilized for the dashboard, and MongoDB was our database with all the customer information. GCP was used for hosting the backend service, and for the Maps API. Finally, we used a variety of Python scripts as well. 

## Challenges I ran into
One of the major challenges that we faced was strategically dividing tasks amongst the team members in accordance with each individuals' expertise. With time, we were able to assess each others' skills and divide work accordingly to achieve our goal.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Each of us made sure to work with a tool/technology which we had never used before, so that the learning experience was maximized. Furthermore, we are very proud that we managed to efficiently work together, even though we were miles away from each other.

## What I learned
We learned how to work together despite not being together physically, which was a large barrier to overcome. Furthermore, we also realized how much could really be done in just 24 hours of work if everyone tried their best and persevered.

## What's next for Bookorona
We want to expand this service for other sectors, not only with fresh produce. For instance, stores which specialize in consumer electronics, home improvement, and so on and so forth.
